How much time did you spend on the assignment?
-I spent roughly 5-6 hrs to complete this project.

If you used a plotting library, why did you choose it?
- I choose to use the Victory plotting libraby because it is
easy to use, responsive, does not need a lot of customizations
because of the built in defaults, built in React and not to mention
it has a well written API. It was also perfect because I did not need
to plot that many point and if I did I might have choosen a canvasing
librabry instead.

What do you like about your implementation?
-I like that my implementation was simple, intuitive and responsive.

If you were to restart, what would you change about your implementation?
-I might have used redux instead to handle state more cleanlt
because my implementation uses the APP component to do all of that and it
gets complicated to handle states. I might also use more methods instead like
willUpdate(), didMount() and so on.

If you were given more time, how would you test your project?
- If I had more time I might have designed for failure to
collect data from users on features I was not sure about to gauge
how I should implement those.
